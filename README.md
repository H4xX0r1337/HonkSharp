## Declarative C\#

We, C# programmers, also deserver beautiful code. We don't have duck typing, arbitrary operators, DUs,
currying, **but** instead we can have fluent coding, lazy properties, and many more.

This repo contains some wrappers and API and methods for fast and convenient declarative coding in C#,
including features from functional, fluent, and lazy programming.
